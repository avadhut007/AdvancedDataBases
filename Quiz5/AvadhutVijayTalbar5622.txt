 2. Get files from this same folder.
   
 3. Name your program/submission with your name and last digits of your ID.

 4a. Using the cloud services provider, all functionality possible should be implemented on that provider.
     (Of course, displaying web pages through a browser and the user interface is "local")

 4b. Upload all data files (*, not this quiz) to cloud service. Put the text file text.txt on the cloud provider.

Show and submit code, when each part is complete, raise your hand and then show us:

 To recieve credit you MUST show (demo) AND submit the code (text only) on Canvas.

 5. Show a web page and interface (which resides on the cloud provider) with your 
    Student ID at the top and below that, your name, at the top of every web page dispayed 
    (for this quiz). Please use a large font.

    (a) Please remove the punctuation and all non-printable ASCII text, and change all characters to lower case.
        Then show the first N characters on a web page, where we will give you the value N in a web interface.
			            if 'char_count5a' in request.form:
                char_count5a = int(request.form["char_count5a"])

                index_sch = open_dir("indexdir")
                list_result5a = ""
                all_docs = index_sch.searcher().documents() 

                for doc in all_docs:
                    list_result5a = doc['content'][0:char_count5a]
                list_result5a = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]','',list_result5a)
                count_remaining = f"Total remaining chars are {len(doc['content']) - char_count5a}"

                return render_template('home.html',list_result5a=list_result5a,count_remaining=count_remaining)
    (b) Please count and display the total number of characters after the first part of step (a) is complete
				            if 'char_count5a' in request.form:
                char_count5a = int(request.form["char_count5a"])

                index_sch = open_dir("indexdir")
                list_result5a = ""
                all_docs = index_sch.searcher().documents() 

                for doc in all_docs:
                    list_result5a = doc['content'][0:char_count5a]
                list_result5a = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]','',list_result5a)
                count_remaining = f"Total remaining chars are {len(doc['content']) - char_count5a}"

                return render_template('home.html',list_result5a=list_result5a,count_remaining=count_remaining)
			
 6. In a web interface allow a user to enter up to 5 words (strings of characters) and print the total number of occurances
    for each word. After that please remove those words. (We will need to use step 5a to see the results)

	
	            if 'search_56' in request.form:
                search_56 = request.form["search_56"]
                word_list = search_56.split(" ")
                print(word_list)
                list_result56 = search_entered_query(search_56)
                print(list_result56)
                word_count = []
                for word in word_list:
                    word_count.append([word,list_result56[0][1].count(word)])
                print(word_count)
                #count_rows51 = f"The count of documents matched is {len(list_result51)}."
                t_headings56 = ["Word", "Count"]

                return render_template('home.html',t_headings56=t_headings56,word_count=word_count)



 7. In a web interface allow a user to give two values: maxlength and minlength, show the first 10 (if they exist) words for
    each length from max to min, for example for 8 and 5, show the first 10 words of length 8 characters, followed by 10 words
    of length 7, then 6, then 5.

 8. Allow a user in a web interface to give two adjacent words and count all occurances of those two words, and show those
    occurances; show the 5 words before and the 5 words after as well as those two words.   
    
 9. Show us, in a link, the application running and we will try it out. Only for parts 5, 6, 7, 8

 10. When complete, return (send) this quiz
     If you finish early, send this immediately, otherwise send between
     the end of class and no more than 1 minute after that.
